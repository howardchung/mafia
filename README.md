mafia
=====

An online implementation of the game Mafia.

A Rails server supporting multiplayer Mafia gameplay.  
Clients make calls to the server's API, which manages the game state.  
Clients then request updates from the server.

In the future, this application may be ported to Node.js and use sockets in order to avoid polling.
